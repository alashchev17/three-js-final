# Three.js Interactive Gallery

An immersive 3D art gallery experience featuring an interactive picture frame that morphs between textures based on mouse movement.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project creates a sophisticated gallery environment where visitors can explore a brick wall with a central picture frame. The frame contains an interactive plane that uses custom shader materials to blend between different magazine textures, creating a dynamic visual experience driven by mouse input.

## ✨ Features

### Required Features ✅
- **glTF Models**: Optimized brick wall and picture frame models
- **HDRI Lighting**: Bethnal Green environment map for realistic illumination  
- **Interactive Shader**: Custom fragment shader with noise-based texture blending
- **Mouse Interactions**: Camera tilt and texture morphing based on cursor position
- **Shadow System**: Proper shadow casting from frame onto wall
- **Performance Optimized**: Texture compression, DPR capping, proper color space handling

### Advanced Features ✨
- **Class-based Architecture**: Clean OOP design with private fields
- **Custom Shaders**: GLSL vertex/fragment shaders with sine wave distortions
- **GSAP Animations**: Smooth camera movements and interactions
- **Raycaster Integration**: Ready for additional click interactions
- **Modular Structure**: Each component is self-contained and reusable

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a clean class-based architecture:

## 🎨 Visual Effects

- **Texture Morphing**: Seamless blending between magazine textures
- **Noise Distortion**: Cloud noise texture creates organic transition patterns  
- **Wave Distortions**: Sine/cosine functions add subtle movement
- **Camera Parallax**: Subtle camera tilt follows mouse movement
- **Realistic Lighting**: HDRI environment with directional shadows

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm run dev

# Build for production  
pnpm run build
```

**Node Version**: 18.19.0 (see `.nvmrc`)

## 🎛️ Technical Decisions

### Model Optimization
- **Brick Wall**: Used original high-detail low-poly model (reasonable file size)
- **Picture Frame**: Maintained detail for shadow casting accuracy
- **No Draco compression needed**: Models already optimized

### Texture Optimization  
- **Magazine Textures**: Selected 2 representative images from paper-mask collection
- **Cloud Noise**: Single noise texture for organic blending patterns
- **Format**: PNG maintained for alpha channel support where needed
- **Resolution**: Kept reasonable sizes (~500KB total texture budget)

### Shader Implementation
- **Vertex Shader**: Simple UV passing with position transformation
- **Fragment Shader**: Complex texture blending with:
  - Time-based noise animation
  - Mouse position influence
  - Sine wave distortions for uniqueness
  - Smooth transitions using `smoothstep()`

### Performance Considerations
- **DPR Capping**: Limited to 2x for performance on high-DPI displays
- **Shadow Quality**: 2048px shadow maps for balance of quality/performance  
- **Minimal Draw Calls**: Efficient geometry usage
- **Texture Memory**: Compressed and optimized all assets

## 🔧 Known Issues & Compromises

- **HDRI Fallback**: If EXR fails to load, directional light provides backup illumination
- **Mobile Performance**: Tested for 60fps on mobile devices
- **Shader Complexity**: Balanced visual effects with performance requirements
